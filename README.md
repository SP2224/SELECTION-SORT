# SELECTION-SORT

 We divide the array into two parts: sorted and unsorted. The left part is sorted subarray and the right part is unsorted subarray. Initially, sorted subarray is empty and unsorted array is the complete given array. 
 ##  or
Selection sort is an algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.
